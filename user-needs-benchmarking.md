# Benchmarking<br>
After our design ideation and choosing an idea concept we were happy with, we set out to benchmark similar ideas that were out in the market, as well as to observe the complaints and positive feedback these ideas received. This was useful, as it gave us insight into what worked well and was well received, as well as giving us foresight on what could go wrong with our design and mistakes to avoid in our product design.

“Doing some work under the southwest desert sun 8+ hours a day, 5 days a week, rugged terrain, this hat is keeping my fair skin safe and fits comfortably on my big head. I have had it for about 2 months now, it has been washed at the laundromat every week (and it gets super dirty), and it is holding up great. Strongly recommend for anyone!”<br>

* The hat fits comfortably on larger heads. (Explicit)<br>

Voice of the Customer<br>
“Hat is listed as unisex. I ordered two, one for myself and one for my wife. The hat is too big for me and my wife's is way too big. The adjustment is insufficient to make any amount of adjustment. I would not recommend this hat because of the adjustment, but I did not like it overall.
The second hat came from a third source (different color) and was folded which creased the bill.”<br>

Voice of the Customer<br>
“It is super reliable, to be honest, I stopped charging it the week after I got it. I work outside and the solar panels constantly receive direct sunlight. A bigger visor protects from the sun on all sides. Definitely would recommend it if you work in direct sunlight. Shipping did take a little long but it is very well made. Worth the money in my opinion as I use it daily.”<br>

Voice of the Customer<br>
"Looks worse in person than in the picture. My average (7 1/2 hat size) head swims in this so the brim blocks my visitor. The fans don’t really cool the head/face.
Blocks view and don't look good."<br>

Restated User Needs:<br>
+ Fans don't work for cooling down (explicit)<br>

+ Hat sags leading to it blocking your face (Latent)<br>

“These hats are great! I have 3 now but they are showing their age after I've replaced the batteries. I wear them almost exclusively. Sometimes you don't know when you are going to need light and I'm always impressed with how smart I am to be wearing this hat with the lights on it! Lol, Simply beautiful. Why didn't they always have these? I'm throwing my other hats away because I've been disappointed ANY night I didn't have them on. “ <br>

“There are only two LITTLE lights, not four, and they are very dim. The only thing they would be good for is finding your way along an unlit path at night. Otherwise, the hat is well-made, looks like it will last, but that isn't what I bought it for." <br>

Description: Adjustable sun rain cap, 37.4” oversize hands free umbrellas, 7-ribs anti-UV waterproof headwear for fishing, gardening, golf, sunshade, and outdoor use.

Positive Comments<br>
Voice of the Customer<br>
"Great idea, allows for doing a lot of things hands-free while keeping the sun/rain off. Keep in mind that it has the weight and underside structure of an umbrella, not a hat, and the bars(?) that hold it up end at the headband, so you can feel them moving on your head a bit. It's probably not something that would be comfortable for hours on end, but it's great for an hour or so."<br>
<br>

Restated User Needs:<br>

+ The hat allows for hands free use. (Explicit)<br>

+ The hat keeps the sun off the skin and protects it. (Explicit)<br>

+ The hats support structure should be well secured to avoid bobbling around when turning/ moving about. (Latent)<br>
<br>


Negative Comments<br>
Voice of the Customer<br>
"I like the size of the umbrella hat. However, it’s very hard to put and stay on your head. Also it’s very flimsy. I cut my fingers on the sharp metal bars that provide the little support there is. The metal needs to be filed or sanded down to prevent the sharp cuts to your fingers."<br>
<br>

Restated User Needs:<br>

+ Durable design. (Latent)<br>

+ Well secured on head and aerodynamic, (won’t blow away). (Latent)<br> 

+ Safe design and materials with no sharp edges. (Latent)<br>
