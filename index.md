# Team Charter
To give us a sense of motivation and goals to strive for, our team set out to create a charter of the things we wanted to gain through the completion of this project. Rather than  "just passing the class" this charter was aimed at the satisfaction or benefits a successful project would give us beyond the scope of the class. 
- Gain more insight into creating electronic systems utilizing industry-level software such as Orcad Cadence, and MPlab.
- Gaining more experience in the design and construction of different serial sensing and actuation circuits.
- Demonstrating a neat project to friends and family.
- Expanding our project resume with an interesting design that conveys what we learned throughout the course.
- Gaining more confidence and familiarity with electrical systems, in general, to give us a higher repertoire of skills when handling future electrical system tasks.

# Mission Statement
Along with the charter, a simple but concise mission statement gave us a clear target to follow while creating the project. 

__To create a device that uses multiple unique sensors to take input from its environment and perform a meaningful or beneficial task. Our goal is to enhance everyday
life by making technology both adaptive and user-friendly. We are committed to responsible design that considers both practicality and sustainability.__

## [Design Selection](Design-Selection.md)
Our team is designing a smart hat with temperature and light sensors to monitor its internal environment. If the temperature goes beyond a set limit, an integrated fan turns on for cooling. The hat's brim also rotates to shield the wearer from direct sunlight, regardless of the sun's position. This tech-infused hat ensures optimal comfort and adaptability for outdoor activities.
