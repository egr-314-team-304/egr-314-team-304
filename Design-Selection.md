# Design Selection
- Our team is developing an innovative hat equipped with an integrated temperature and light sensor to monitor the internal conditions in real-time. This smart hat is designed to provide optimal comfort while facilitating in keeping the user cool and shaded. The embedded sensors diligently track the temperature and light exposure, ensuring the wearer remains well-informed about the internal ambiance.

- In instances where the temperature rises beyond a comfortable threshold, an in-built fan activates automatically to cool down the interior, providing a refreshing and comfortable experience for the wearer.

Additionally, the brim of the hat rotates to follow the direction of the sunlight to automatically shade the user from the sun whether it is in fron of them or behind them.
This fusion of fashion and technology not only enhances comfort but also adapts to varying environmental conditions, making it a practical choice for outdoor enthusiasts and individuals spending considerable time outdoors.
