# Cool Cap Project

# Team Schedule
Allocating time to work together and having a clear team schedule are essential components to creating a successful team project. Our team set out to find the best times we could meet to make progress on the project. To do so, we each put down the times we were available to meet and work on the project on a spreadsheet. From there, we found time periods we were all free to meet up and work on the project together.

We found times on Monday and Wednesday at 11:00 AM and 3:00 PM right after class. While these times could work for small exchanges and checkups, the best meeting time that would allow us the most work done is Friday between 10:00 AM and noon.

# Communication Methods

We have agreed to communicate primarily via Discord and use group text and GitHub as secondary communication. Communicating via text will be our most synchronous communication method, with Discord being semi-synchronous and Google Drive being asynchronous. While synchronous communications are the fastest and most reliable, the other two options offer more in-depth forms of communication and allow us to share our work and progress on objectives more efficiently.
