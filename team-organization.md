# Cool Cap Project

# Team Charter
To give us a sense of motivation and goals to strive for, our team set out to create a charter of the things we wanted to gain through the completion of this project. Rather than  "just passing the class" this charter was aimed at the satisfaction or benefits a successful project would give us beyond the scope of the class. 
- Gain more insight into creating electronic systems utilizing industry-level software such as Orcad Cadence, and MPlab.
- Gaining more experience in the design and construction of different serial sensing and actuation circuits.
- Demonstrating a neat project to friends and family.
- Expanding our project resume with an interesting design that conveys what we learned throughout the course.
- Gaining more confidence and familiarity with electrical systems, in general, to give us a higher repertoire of skills when handling future electrical system tasks.

# Mission Statement
Along with the charter, a simple but concise mission statement gave us a clear target to follow while creating the project. 

__To create a device that uses multiple unique sensors to take input from its environment and perform a meaningful or beneficial task. Our goal is to enhance everyday
life by making technology both adaptive and user-friendly. We are committed to responsible design that considers both practicality and sustainability.__

# Team Schedule
Allocating time to work together and having a clear team schedule are essential components to creating a successful team project. Our team set out to find the best times we could meet to make progress on the project. To do so, we each put down the times we were available to meet and work on the project on a spreadsheet. From there, we found time periods we were all free to meet up and work on the project together.

We found times on Monday and Wednesday at 11:00 AM and 3:00 PM right after class. While these times could work for small exchanges and checkups, the best meeting time that would allow us the most work done is Friday between 10:00 AM and noon.

# Communication Methods

We have agreed to communicate primarily via Discord and use group text and GitHub as secondary communication. Communicating via text will be our most synchronous communication method, with Discord being semi-synchronous and Google Drive being asynchronous. While synchronous communications are the fastest and most reliable, the other two options offer more in-depth forms of communication and allow us to share our work and progress on objectives more efficiently.
